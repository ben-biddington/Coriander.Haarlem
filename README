I would like to be able to examine teamcity build configurations,
so that I can see the interesting things at a glance.

I have tried using the API itself to no avail, there seems to be no way to connect
directly to teamcity via http.

They tell me the way this is done is via some XML file exposed over HTTP.
And that to expose it, a plugin is required:

    @spav5: sounds like you need to export build configuration settings to xml format.
    in fact they are in xml on disk, in config dir

    @me: Can't I connect directly?

    @spav5: there is no way to get these xml files by http, this can be done with help of a simple plugin
